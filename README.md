# fancy-cat
A (blazingly-fast) PDF viewer for terminals using the Kitty image protocol (written in Zig).
![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32393f0a-2cc3-438d-8c4e-870317714c2a)[^1]
[^1]: This demo shows me editing a Typst file that automatically compiles with each change, prompting fancy-cat to re-render whenever the PDF updates.
